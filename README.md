# Bikeshare Starter Project

This is the bikeshare starter project from Udacity that I complete as part of the
_Introduction to Version Control_ course on 17&nbsp;Feb 2026.

The bikeshare starter project consists of a single Python file (`bikeshare_starter.py`) that
apparently pulls out information from one or more comma-separated value files and analyzes the data
according to city, month, and day supplied interactively by the user.

## License

Udacity did not provide a license for their files, so it's probably their copyright plus whatever
I will or will not complete on the bikeshare starter Python code.
